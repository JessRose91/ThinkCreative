        <h1>Creativity Definition</h1>
        <p class="defRef">Synthesised from: Oxford Learners Dictionary, American Psychology Association.</p>
        <p class="def">Creativity is the ability to go beyond the ordinary to produce or develop original work, theories, 
        techniques or thoughts, typically displaying originality, imagination, and expressiveness.</p>
        <p class="def"> It can be practised and developed in many different outlets, such as the visual arts, 
        literature, sciences, creating problems, solving problems, and general day-to-day life. </p>

        <h1>Creativity Fun Facts</h1>
        <p class="def">1: Creativity is not something you just have or not; creativity can be learned, practised, and nurtured. 
        It is something you can continue to improve on.</p>
        <img class="Cog" src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.svg" alt="Green Spinning Cog">
        <p class="def">2: Creativity is driven by curiosity and exploration.</p>
        <img class="Cog" src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.svg" alt="Green Spinning Cog">
        <p class="def">3: Creativity is subjective based on unique perspectives and experiences shaping the individual's creative 
        expressions, resulting in a diverse range of creative outputs. What is considered creative can change from person to person.</p>
        <img class="Cog" src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.svg" alt="Green Spinning Cog">
        <p class="def">4: Our environments can have a huge impact on our creativity. Well-designed spaces with adequate lighting and 
        comfort can stimulate creative thinking. As can colours, sounds, and smells.</p>
        <img class="Cog" src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.svg" alt="Green Spinning Cog">
        <p class="def">5: Our moods and emotions can affect our creativity. Positive emotions can enhance creativity, but our more 
        challenging and difficult emotions can inspire them. So, try to be creative even if you are upset or angry.</p>
        <img class="Cog" src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.svg" alt="Green Spinning Cog">
        <p class="def">6: Creativity is a risk-taking activity. Embracing uncertainty and being willing to make mistakes can 
        lead to breakthrough ideas and innovative solutions.</p>
        <img class="Cog" src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.svg" alt="Green Spinning Cog">
        <p class="def">7: Creativity is needed for progress and innovation. Without creativity, our world and lives would be vastly different.</p>

                <h3>Step 1-Preparation:</h3>
                <p class="def">The preparation stage is about researching and deliberately 
                exploring the problem in different contexts and from different perspectives.</p>
                <p class="def">It is a learning phase through which we expand our concepts and understand that endless possibilities exist.</p>
            </sl-carousel-item>
            <sl-carousel-item> 
                <h3>Step 2-Incubation:</h3>
                <p class="def">The second step occurs subconsciously and can appear more enigmatic as the intention is to no longer focus on the problem.</p>
                <p class="def">This can be difficult when the purpose of this process is centred around creativity and developing new ideas, but it can be helpful 
                to either focus on another problem or task or try to do nothing but relax. This will allow the brain to relax and incubate all the 
                learning achieved in the preparation stage.</p>
            </sl-carousel-item>
            <sl-carousel-item> 
                <h3>Step 3-Illumination:</h3>
                <p class="def">This is the peak creative stage, when your brain develops great ideas and connects pieces together, bringing solutions to light.</p>
                <p class="def">These Illuminating moments can happen at any time, in any situation, but can commonly include while showering and toileting, 
                just before you fall asleep and while walking or driving.</p>
            </sl-carousel-item>
            <sl-carousel-item> 
                <h3>Step 4-Verification:</h3>
                <p class="def">In this final stage, we evaluate one of these ideas, verify that it is realistic and an appropriate or worthy solution, and start 
                building the framework around it to bring it to life. </p>
                <p class="def">If needed, we modify/adapt the ideas or disregard it and pick another idea to verify.</p>

                <h3>Step 1-Identify Goals:</h3>
                <p class="def">Begin creating a better future: What does the 
                individual, team, organization or culture have “care, concern or desire” for?</p>
                <p class="def">Of all of the things that are cared about, which one carries the most 
                energy or excitement in this moment? </p>
                <p class="def">Which, if resolved, will move you or the team more fully in the 
                direction they wish for now?</p>
            </sl-carousel-item>
            <sl-carousel-item> 
                <h3>Step 2-Gather Input/Insight:</h3>
                <p class="def">What is everything knowable that might impact our thought processes 
                as we progress in resolving our most important care? What is important data? What 
                human aspects of this should we develop empathy for?</p>
                <p class="def">What are the feelings from various groups about this focus? What 
                seemingly unrelated information is there that might have an influence as we move forward?</p>
                <p class="def">What have we not considered that we might be wise to consider?</p>
                <p class="def">Which input does the data, group-think and personal intuition cause us to see as most important?</p>
            </sl-carousel-item>
            <sl-carousel-item> 
                <h3>Step 3-Carify Challenges:</h3>
                <p class="def">What is everything knowable that might impact our thought processes 
                as we progress in resolving our most important care? What is important data? What 
                human aspects of this should we develop empathy for?</p>
                <p class="def">What are the feelings from various groups about this focus? What 
                seemingly unrelated information is there that might have an influence as we move forward?</p>
                <p class="def">What have we not considered that we might be wise to consider?</p>
            </sl-carousel-item>
            <sl-carousel-item> 
                <h3>Step 4-Generate Ideas:</h3>
                <p class="def">Create some options: What might be all the ways to solve the challenge/problem being focused on now?</p>
                <p class="def">Among all those ways, which of them (often more than one, or a combination of many) does the data, group think, 
                personal intuition and current capacity/skill attract us to implementing?</p>
            </sl-carousel-item>
            <sl-carousel-item> 
                <h3>Step 5-Prototype and Strengthen:</h3>
                <p class="def">Try to test some solutions by creating concept illustrations, models, mock-ups, validation experiments or storyboards. 
                While testing hypotheses, consider which ideas will help us overcome our challenges and achieve our goals.</p>
                <p class="def"> Also, think about what is being learnt and how solutions might be strengthened. What new challenges are inherent in the possible 
                solutions and how can these be amended for any of the solutions to be successful? Finally Which solution is good enough (for now) to implement?</p>
            </sl-carousel-item>
            <sl-carousel-item> 
                <h3>Step 6-Plan for Action:</h3>
                <p class="def">Design a project plan, considering and highlighting all the specific actions that must be implemented to make our solution a reality. Then, 
                identify and outline which are the top priorities and when they need to be completed to stay on track.</p>
            </sl-carousel-item>
            <sl-carousel-item> 
                <h3>Step 7-Implement and Evaluate:</h3>
                <p class="def">Assure that the chosen options are implemented consistently and that, where modifications are needed, you understand why and make them happen.</p>
                <p class="def">It is also crucial to think about what happens after implementation. What is the mechanism and timing for a review of the effectiveness of the 
                solution? How will control and consistency be assured?</p>

        <h3>Prompts and Challenges 1: 30 Circles</h3>
        <p class="def">You will need a piece of paper/card (of any size, or several if needed) with 30 plain circles (any size). 
        The challenge is to turn each circle into a different recognisable object/item, e.g., a sunflower or a bowling ball.</p>
        <p class="def"> Try repeating the task with a piece of paper of a different size. To extend on this, consider using one 
        or more of these solutions to create a scene using the method of your choice, i.e. writing, drawing, sculpting, etc.</p>

        <h3>Prompts and Challenges 7: The Unexplored Ocean:</h3>
        <p class="def">According to National Geographic (2024), over 80% of Earth's oceans remain unexplored. 
        You have decided you will be the one to explore and map this.</p>
        <p class="def">The first step is to design, draw/describe/sculpt the submersible technology to do this; 
        it needs to be able to at least film all 360 degrees of the surrounding area.</p>
        <p class="def">Questions to consider and possibly answer: What does this submersible look like? what does it sound like?
        how does it move and explore? how does it withstand pressure? and what technologies does it use? How does it supply you with air? 
        What food and drink are available and how? How will you relax and sleep? How will you continuously film and record information?</p>

        Put them word-side down in a loose pile. </p>
        <p class="def">Complete the same task with verbs, adjectives and adverbs ensuring each type is in its own pile.</p>
        <p class="def">Once you have done this, randomly pick one word from each pile. This is the prompt for the next 
        piece of creative writing or art you complete.</p>
        <p class="def">Repeat this as many times as you like and store them for future prompts.</p>

        <p class="def">Visit the<a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/"> 80,000 HOURS WEBSITE</a> or alternatively google the biggest problems we 
        need to solve (or similar), pick one of the problems and start brainstorming/mind mapping (or another problem-solving/creative thinking process) any possible solution.</p>
        <p class="def">This doesn't have to be realistic or within the scope of our abilities and technologies we have right now. Start making connections between 
        each idea if possible, and narrow down your list to a few you think could be best/ or you like the most and explore this idea through drawings or descriptions 
        or stories, or you could even create prototypes.</p>

        <p class="def">Sit outside, go to a mall, a coffee shop, or the beach, anywhere you can sit and observe people and animals 
        and pick a person or an animal that intrigues you. Begin to observe your chosen subject and create (written or drawn) a 
        back story for your chosen observation.</p>
        <p class="def">If you don't feel comfortable or able to draw or write this in person - make good notes for use later; alternatively,

        <h3>Prompts and Challenges 17: Adapting to Future:</h3>
        <p class="def">Our life as we know it is about to end/change, Volcanic cracks are beginning to appear worldwide on land and
        ocean floors; pyroclastic flows (flowing mix of rocks, gas and ash) are appearing, everything is heating up, 
        massive eruptions are imminent, and so are tsunamis.</p>
        <p class="def">What is the outcome for us, i.e. do we survive and somehow adapt? Do some of us make it off the planet to start a new colony; 
        maybe even back to Earth if nature recovers? Do we go extinct like the dinosaurs, but some evolutions of living beings survive and 
        continue to evolve? If so, what comes next?</p>
    </sl-dialog>
    <sl-dialog class="PromptsChallenges PromptsChallenges18" style="--width:50vw;">
        <h3>Prompts and Challenges 18: Cogs of Time:</h3>
        <p class="def">Use this as a writing or drawing prompt:  As the cogs turn forward, so does time. If only we could control time with cogs: 
        turning back time, stopping time, slowing it down, or speeding it up.</p>
        <p class="def">Maybe if we added or took cogs away, we could create new timelines or take cogs from one timeline and put them in another. 
        Imagine if time travel and entering different timelines was as simple as taking your cog out of the current timeline and placing it at a different point.</p>
        <p class="def">This could create the potential, for better or worse, for creating new worlds or endless destruction, manipulating events and opportunities.</p>

        <h1>Creative Thinking Definition</h1>
        <p class="defRef">Synthesised from: American Psychology Association, 
        Australian Council for Education Research, Oxford University.</p>
        <p class="def">Creative Thinking, just like creativity, falls on a spectrum 
        of beliefs and ways of doing with no singular, wholly accepted definition. A 
        generalised understanding is that creative thinking is a way of looking at problems or 
        situations from new or different perspectives; it is the mental process leading to new 
        possibilities, new ideas, inventions, solutions, or syntheses in any area.</p> 
        <p class="def">Solutions could be completely new or use pre-existing elements that have been adapted 
        and/or combined, creating new relationships between them. People might use several ways of 
        thinking, including lateral, divergent, and convergent thinking.</p>
        <h3>Lateral Thinking</h3>
        <p class="def">Lateral thinking is based on finding creative or alternative solutions to a 
        challenge beyond logical or deductive reasoning, basically seeking to solve problems using unique methods. 
        This relies on creative thinking, and the ability to consider every aspect of a situation with a 
        unique approach or the willingness to look at things in a different way.</p>
        <h3>Divergent Thinking</h3>
        <p class="def">In simple terms, divergent thinking is when a person uses creativity and follows many lines of 
        thought and the free flow of ideas to examine a problem to generate new/original solutions. Essentially,
        it is a non-linear thought process that analyses a solution on a broad scale and encourages multiple and 
        relatively scattered solutions. Compared to other thought processes, divergent thinking is a non-linear method. 
        It includes shifting perspective on existing information (seeing it in a new way) or transforming it, for 
        instance, through unexpected combinations of elements usually not regarded as belonging together.</p>
        <h3>Convergent Thinking</h3>
        <p class="def">The convergent thought process involves using logic and established information to reach a definitive solution, 
        often eliminating ambiguity and conducting steps, such as examining logical data and establishing constraints, to make 
        an informed conclusion. It evaluates various possibilities and applies established rules and logical reasoning to converge 
        on a single answer or the best possible solution. This is done using structure reasoning in sequential order, and critical evaluation 
        where each step logically follows the preceding and each possibility is analysed and dissected, clearing out the weaknesses and 
        flaws leaving only the most viable options for solutions.</p>

                <p class="def">In this mode, you look at your information, identify what you don't have, 
                and consider how to get additional information.</p>
                <p class="def">When the White Hat is in use, participants are encouraged to present existing data, 
                including statistics, reports, and tangible evidence relevant to the topic at hand. the White Hat 
                is about developing an informed understanding of the situation.</p>
            </sl-carousel-item>
            <sl-carousel-item> 
                <h3>Blue Hat-Control, Process and Co-ordination:</h3>
                <p class="def">The Blue Hat serves as the conductor of the thinking process, offering a crucial overarching 
                perspective that ensures structure and focus.</p>
                <p class="def">Distinct from the other hats, which are concerned with specific types of thinking, the Blue Hat is about 
                managing the thinking process itself. It's the hat worn by the meeting's facilitator or leader, guiding the discussion, 
                setting the agenda, and ensuring that each of the other hats is effectively utilised in turn.</p>
                <p class="def">The primary purpose of the Blue Hat is to maintain a clear focus and direction throughout a discussion or decision-making process. 
                This involves establishing the objectives at the outset, defining the sequence in which the other hats will be used, and keeping the discussion on track. 
                The Blue Hat is responsible for summarizing and synthesizing the inputs from the other hats, drawing conclusions, and planning the next steps. 
                It's about seeing the 'big picture' and ensuring the process is coherent and productive.</p>

            <sl-carousel-item> 
                <h3>Yellow Hat-Optimism, Positivity and Possibility:</h3>
                <p class="def">This hat encourages participants to explore the positive aspects of a situation, focusing on opportunities, benefits, and value.</p>
                <p class="def">Unlike the cautionary Black Hat, the Yellow Hat is about envisioning the best-case scenarios and the potential rewards that can 
                arise from a particular strategy or decision.</p>
                <p class="def">The intrinsic value of the Yellow Hat lies in its ability to counterbalance the natural tendency towards critical or negative thinking 
                that often dominates group discussions. By intentionally seeking out the positives, this hat helps to cultivate a sense of hope and motivation, 
                which can be particularly crucial in driving innovation and creative problem solving. It prompts participants to look beyond immediate obstacles 
                and consider the long-term potential and growth opportunities.</p>
            </sl-carousel-item>
            <sl-carousel-item> 
                <h3>Red Hat-Feelings, Subjectivity and Instinct:</h3>
                <p class="def">The Red Hat's primary value lies in its ability to bring forth the underlying emotional responses that might otherwise go unspoken 
                or be considered irrelevant in more traditional, data-driven discussions.</p>
                <p class="def">By explicitly inviting emotional input, this Hat ensures that these insights are not only voiced but also respected and considered 
                as part of the holistic understanding of the issue at hand. This process can be particularly enlightening, revealing personal values, 
                concerns, and motivations that might significantly influence the direction and acceptance of decisions.</p>
                <p class="def">Another key consideration is the recognition that emotional responses, while not always based on logic or fact, are genuine 
                and can provide invaluable insights into personal and collective morale, apprehension, enthusiasm, and other critical factors that could 
                influence the success or failure of a decision or project.</p>
            </sl-carousel-item>
            <sl-carousel-item> 
                <h3>Green Hat-Creativity, Imagination, and Lateral Thinking:</h3>
                <p class="def">The green hat is specifically designed to foster out-of-the-box thinking, encouraging participants to explore 
                new ideas, alternative solutions, and unconventional approaches.</p>
                <p class="def"> This hat is the antithesis of the status quo, challenging the norms and pushing boundaries in the pursuit of 
                creative problem solving.</p>
                <p class="def">The essence of the Green Hat lies in its ability to cultivate a fertile ground for creativity. 
                When this hat is in play, participants are encouraged to think freely without the constraints of practicality or criticism. 
                It's a time for brainstorming, where quantity and variety of ideas are more important than immediate feasibility.</p>

                    <h3>Step 1-Empathize:</h3>
                    <p class="def">Conduct research to learn what your users do, say, think, and feel. 
                    Imagine your goal is to improve an onboarding experience for new users. 
                    In this phase, you talk to a range of actual users.</p>
                    <p class="def">Directly observe what they do, think, and want, asking yourself things like: 
                    What motivates or discourages users? Where do they experience frustration? The goal is to gather 
                    enough observations that you can truly begin to empathize with your users and their perspectives.</p>
                </sl-carousel-item>
                <sl-carousel-item> 
                    <h3>Step 2-Define:</h3>
                    <p class="def">Combine all your research and observe where your users' problems exist. 
                    While pinpointing your users' needs, begin to highlight opportunities for innovation. Consider the onboarding example again.</p>
                    <p class="def">In the define phase, use the data gathered in the empathize phase to glean insights. Organize all 
                    your observations and draw parallels across your users' current experiences. Is there a common pain 
                    point across many different users? Identify unmet user needs.</p>
                </sl-carousel-item>
                <sl-carousel-item> 
                    <h3>Step 3-Ideate:</h3>
                    <p class="def">Brainstorm a range of crazy, creative ideas that address the unmet user needs identified in the define phase.
                    Give yourself total freedom; no idea is too farfetched, and quantity supersedes quality.</p>
                    <p class="def">At this phase, draw out as many different ideas as you can. Then, reflect/evaluate and consider mixing and 
                    remixing, building on the different ideas.</p>
                </sl-carousel-item>
                <sl-carousel-item> 
                    <h3>Step 4-Prototype:</h3>
                    <p class="def">Build real, tactile representations for a subset of your ideas. The goal of this phase is to understand what components 
                    of your ideas work, and which do not. In this phase you begin to weigh the impact vs. feasibility of your ideas through feedback on your prototypes.</p>
                    <p class="def">Make your ideas tactile. If you can, evaluate and get feedback from others. If needed, make alterations based on feedback, 
                    then prototype it again. Repeat as many times as needed.</p>
                </sl-carousel-item>
                <sl-carousel-item> 
                    <h3>Step 5-Test:</h3>
                    <p class="def">Ask yourself, Does this solution meet users' needs? and Has it improved how they feel, think, or do their tasks? Put your prototype in front of 
                    real customers and verify that it achieves your goals.</p>
                    <p class="def">If not, determine where it has gone wrong, think about, ideate and implement possible solutions and test again.</p>
                    <h3>Step 6-Implement:</h3>
                    <p class="def">Put the vision into effect. Ensure that your solution materialises and touches your end users' lives.</p>

                        <p class="def">Mind maps assist big-picture thinking by giving you an overview and a stronger understanding of a larger topic/problem
                         by highlighting and sorting smaller details into branches. Because mind maps are similar to the way our brains think, 
                         the associations and links we create feel more natural.</p>

        </sl-tooltip>
        <p class="def">1: Ask questions and challenge any assumptions and existing norms by asking what-ifs, 
        how, why, can it/I, and allowing yourself to explore new possibilities. Asking such questions can help 
        you connect thoughts and ideas and think differently.</p>
        <img class="Cog" src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.svg" alt="Green Spinning Cog">
        <p class="def">2: Seek new perspectives and seek out differing viewpoints and ways of thinking and doing 
        by exposing yourself to various cultures, disciplines, and interests. Broaden your horizons and 
        improve your ability to think creatively.</p>
        <img class="Cog" src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.svg" alt="Green Spinning Cog">
        <p class="def">3: Allow free thinking and mind wandering. Don't let yourself be restricted in your thoughts 
        and ideas. The sky is the limit, so let the brain juices flow. Set aside time regularly to allow your mind 
        to wander, brainstorm and encourage free thinking, and doodle or write anything you want on paper to train your imagination.</p>
        <img class="Cog" src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.svg" alt="Green Spinning Cog">
        <p class="def">4: Take time, where possible, to bounce your ideas off others and gain their perspectives and ideas; 
        they will likely think of something you haven't.</p>
        <img class="Cog" src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.svg" alt="Green Spinning Cog">
        <p class="def">5: Take regular breaks; take a breather when you feel stuck with an idea. Forcing yourself to find a 
        solution will lead to exhaustion and burnout. Try going for a walk outside, grab a coffee or something to eat, talk 
        to people and/or just look at the scenery around you. Remember, some inspirations will strike you at unexpected times and places.</p>
        <img class="Cog" src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.svg" alt="Green Spinning Cog">
        <p class="def">6: Take risks; while this can be a double-edged sword, risks allow you to think out of the box, look for 
        unconventional ideas and embrace the differences.</p>
        <img class="Cog" src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.svg" alt="Green Spinning Cog">
        <p class="def">7: Find or create opportunities to stimulate your brain with new experiences. Go to an art gallery or museum, 
        go to a new part of your neighbourhood, go into an eatery you have never been to before, go see a performance, go into a 
        shop/window shop at a shop you would normally go into, listen to new music/music you would normally listen to or any new experiences you can think of.</p>
        <img class="Cog" src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.svg" alt="Green Spinning Cog">
        <p class="def">8: Unlock and embrace your inner child; step into pretend mode and participate in world-building (dreaming up entirely new worlds) 
        and perspective-shifting (thinking like another). The goal is to embrace openness toward new ideas and uncharted territory and think like an 
        adventure-seeking kid again.</p>
        <img class="Cog" src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.svg" alt="Green Spinning Cog">
        <p class="def">9: Take notes; inspiration and creative thought can strike at the most random times. When it strikes, 
        whether on paper or a phone app, jot the thought or idea down; otherwise, you may forget and not get it back.</p>
        <img class="Cog" src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.svg" alt="Green Spinning Cog">
        <p class="def">10: Keep a journal or scrapbook of inspirations; include images, little doodles, mark-making, and sketches of 
        any ideas where applicable and note any relevant emotions/feelings at the time, too.</p>

        <p class="defRef">Synthesised from: Cambridge University, Merriam-Webster.</p>
        <p class="def">Problem-solving is a process that occurs through higher mental functions, 
        such as reasoning and creative thinking.</p>
        <p class="def">It is centred around identifying, well-defining and understanding problems, 
        then determining the cause or causes of the problem before identifying and prioritizing possible 
        solutions, implementing the best course of action, testing and evaluating these solutions and, 
        if needed, adapting or choosing a different course of action.</p>
        <p class="def">There are several different methods and processes that could be used in 
        problem-solving, including brainstorming, mind-mapping, lightning decision jam, 
        design sprint, and crazy eight technique.</p>

                can have different ideas on outcomes or goals for a problem.</p>
                <p class="def"> By choosing an objective first, the problem solving process can be expedited. Goals don't need to be ambitious, 
                detailed, or agreed upon when working in a team.</p>
            </sl-carousel-item>
            <sl-carousel-item>

            <sl-carousel-item> 
                <h3>Step 1-Define the Problem:</h3>
                <p class="def">Take the time to analyse the issue and gather as much information as 
                possible including identifying and understanding the root cause of the problem, 
                how does the problem effect you/others, what are the contributing factors, what would you like to solve.</p>
            </sl-carousel-item>
            <sl-carousel-item> 
                <h3>Step 2-Brainstorm Possible Solutions:</h3>
                <p class="def">Brainstorm possible solutions and come up with as many solutions as possible, 
                even if they seem unrealistic or impractical. Brainstorming can be done individually or in a 
                group setting, where contributors can bounce ideas off each other.</p>
                <p class="def">Remember to focus on generating ideas, without evaluating or criticizing them during the brainstorming session. 
                Once you have a list of possible solutions, evaluate each based on feasibility and potential impacts.</p>
                <p class="def"> It's important to consider the pros and cons of each solution before selecting the most appropriate one. 
                Remember that the solution may not be perfect, but it should be the best one available, given the resources and constraints.</p>
            </sl-carousel-item>
            <sl-carousel-item> 
                <h3>Step 3-Evaluate the Solutions:</h3>
                <p class="def">When evaluating potential solutions, it's important to consider both the short-term and long-term effects of each. 
                For instance, while changing the project scope may seem like a quick fix to a delayed project, it could cause further delays 
                or even impact the project's success in the long run.</p>
                <p class="def">During the evaluation stage, it is necessary to prioritize solutions based on their impact on the problem and feasibility. 
                Consider the resources, time, and effort required to implement each solution.</p>
                <p class="def"> It is also important to remember that not all solutions may work as expected. Be prepared to modify or pivot to a different 
                solution if the initial solution does not yield the desired results.</p>
            </sl-carousel-item>
            <sl-carousel-item> 
                <h3>Step 4-Implement Solution:</h3>
                <p class="def">After planning how to do it, what is needed, what steps need to be taken and in what order, put the solution into effect. 
                It is also a good idea to track the implementation progress and ensure it runs smoothly and on track.</p>
                <h3>Step 5-Monitor and Adjust:</h3>
                <p class="def">Monitoring and adjusting the solution is important in ensuring the problem is resolved/solved. It's essential to track the 
                progress of the solution and evaluate its effectiveness. If the solution is not working as planned, adjust it accordingly.</p>

        <sl-carousel-item> 
            <h3>Step 1-Define the Problem:</h3>
            <p class="def">This step is crucial; finding a solution is only accessible if the problem is clearly defined. 
            One way to do this is to ask the right questions.</p>
            <p class="def">Questions like What is the problem? and What are the causes of the problem? can help. 
            Data and information about the issue are also essential to assist in the definition process.</p>
        </sl-carousel-item>
        <sl-carousel-item> 
            <h3>Step 2-Disaggregate:</h3>
            <p class="def">After defining the problem, the next step is to disaggregate the problem into smaller, 
            more manageable parts; this helps break down the problem into smaller pieces that can be analysed individually.</p>
            <p class="def">This step is crucial in understanding the root cause of the problem and identifying the most effective solutions.</p>
            <p class="def">Disaggregation can be achieved by breaking down the problem into sub-problems, identifying the contributing factors, 
            and analysing the relationships between these factors. This step helps identify the most critical factors that must be 
            addressed to solve the problem</p>
        </sl-carousel-item>
        <sl-carousel-item> 
            <h3>Step 3-Prioritise:</h3>
            <p class="def">After defining the problem and disaggregating it into smaller parts, the next step in the 7-step problem solving 
            process is prioritising the issues that need addressing. Prioritising helps to focus on the most pressing issues and 
            allocate resources more effectively.</p>
            <p class="def">There are several ways to prioritise issues, including:<br>
                •	Urgency: Prioritise issues based on their urgency. Problems that require immediate attention should be addressed first.<br>
                •	Impact: Prioritize issues based on their impact on the organization or stakeholders. Problems with a high impact should 
                be given priority.<br>
                •	Resources: Prioritise issues based on the resources required to address them. Problems that require fewer resources 
                should be dealt with first.</p>
            <p class="def">Once the issues have been prioritised, developing a plan of action to address them is essential. This involves identifying 
            the resources required, setting timelines, and assigning responsibilities.</p>
        </sl-carousel-item>
        <sl-carousel-item> 
            <h3>Step 4-Workplan:</h3>
            <p class="def">Develop a work plan; this should include a list of tasks and deadlines and can help keep the process on track.</p>
            <p class="def">It can also help to identify potential roadblocks or challenges that may arise during the problem solving process 
            and develop contingency plans to address them.</p>
        </sl-carousel-item>
        <sl-carousel-item> 
            <h3>Step 5-Analysis:</h3>
            <p class="def">This step involves examining the data, identifying patterns, and determining the root cause of the problem.<br>
                Several methods can be used during the analysis phase, including: Root cause analysis, Pareto analysis, SWOT analysis.</p>
            <p class="def">•  Root cause analysis is a popular method used to identify the underlying cause of a problem. 
            This method involves asking a series of "why" questions to get to the root cause of the issue.<br>
            •  Pareto analysis is another method that can be used during the analysis phase. This method involves 
            identifying the 20% of causes responsible for 80% of the problems. By focusing on these critical causes, organizations 
            can make significant improvements.<br>
            •  Finally, SWOT analysis is a valuable tool for analysing the internal and external factors that may impact the problem. 
            This method involves identifying the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to the issue.</p>
        </sl-carousel-item>
        <sl-carousel-item> 
            <h3>Step 6-Synthesize:</h3>
            <p class="def">Once the analysis phase is complete, it is time to synthesize the information gathered to arrive at a solution. 
            During this step, the focus is on identifying the most viable solution that addresses the problem. This involves examining and 
            combining the analysis results for a clear and concise conclusion.</p>
            <p class="def">One way to synthesize the information is to use a decision matrix. This involves creating a table that 
            lists the potential solutions and the essential criteria for deciding. Each answer is then rated against each standard, and the 
            scores are tallied to arrive at a final decision.<br>
            Another approach to synthesizing the information is to use a mind map. This involves creating a visual representation of the problem 
            and the potential solutions. The mind map can identify the relationships between the different pieces of information and help prioritize the solutions.<br>
            During the synthesis phase, remaining open-minded and considering all potential solutions is vital. Involving all stakeholders in the decision-making 
            process ensures everyone's perspectives are considered.</p>
        </sl-carousel-item>
        <sl-carousel-item> 
            <h3>Step 7-Communicate:</h3>
            <p class="def">After synthesizing the information, the next step is communicating the findings to the relevant stakeholders if applicable. 
            This is a crucial step because it helps to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that the decision-making process is transparent.</p>
