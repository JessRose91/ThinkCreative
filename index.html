        <h1>Creativity Definition</h1>
        <p class="defRef">Synthesised from: Oxford Learners Dictionary, American Psychology Association.</p>
        <p class="def">Creativity is the ability to go beyond the ordinary to produce or develop original work, theories, 
        techniques or thoughts, typically displaying originality, imagination, and expressiveness.</p>
        <p class="def"> It can be practised and developed in many different outlets, such as the visual arts, 
        literature, sciences, creating problems, solving problems, and general day-to-day life. </p>

        <h1>Creativity Fun Facts</h1>
        <p class="def">1: Creativity is not something you just have or not; creativity can be learned, practised, and nurtured. 
        It is something you can continue to improve on.</p>
        <img src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.png" alt="row of alternating cogs and lighbulbs">
        <p class="def">2: Creativity is driven by curiosity and exploration.</p>
        <img src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.png" alt="row of alternating cogs and lighbulbs">
        <p class="def">3: Creativity is subjective based on unique perspectives and experiences shaping the individual's creative 
        expressions, resulting in a diverse range of creative outputs. What is considered creative can change from person to person.</p>
        <img src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.png" alt="row of alternating cogs and lighbulbs">
        <p class="def">4: Our environments can have a huge impact on our creativity. Well-designed spaces with adequate lighting and 
        comfort can stimulate creative thinking. As can colours, sounds, and smells.</p>
        <img src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.png" alt="row of alternating cogs and lighbulbs">
        <p class="def">5: Our moods and emotions can affect our creativity. Positive emotions can enhance creativity, but our more 
        challenging and difficult emotions can inspire them. So, try to be creative even if you are upset or angry.</p>
        <img src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.png" alt="row of alternating cogs and lighbulbs">
        <p class="def">6: Creativity is a risk-taking activity. Embracing uncertainty and being willing to make mistakes can 
        lead to breakthrough ideas and innovative solutions.</p>
        <img src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.png" alt="row of alternating cogs and lighbulbs">
        <p class="def">7: Creativity is needed for progress and innovation. Without creativity, our world and lives would be vastly different.</p>

        <h3>Prompts and Challenges 18: Cogs of Time:</h3>
        <p class="def">Use this as a writing or drawing prompt:  As the cogs turn forward, so does time. If only we could control time with cogs: 
        turning back time, stopping time, slowing it down, or speeding it up.</p>
        <p class="def">Maybe if we added or took cogs away, we could create new timelines or take cogs from one timeline and put them in another. 
        Imagine if time travel and entering different timelines was as simple as taking your cog out of the current timeline and placing it at a different point.</p>
        <p class="def">This could create the potential, for better or worse, for creating new worlds or endless destruction, manipulating events and opportunities.</p>

        <h1>Creative Thinking Definition</h1>
        <p class="defRef">Synthesised from: American Psychology Association, 
        Australian Council for Education Research, Oxford University.</p>
        <p class="def">Creative Thinking, just like creativity, falls on a spectrum 
        of beliefs and ways of doing with no singular, wholly accepted definition. A 
        generalised understanding is that creative thinking is a way of looking at problems or 
        situations from new or different perspectives; it is the mental process leading to new 
        possibilities, new ideas, inventions, solutions, or syntheses in any area.</p> 
        <p class="def">Solutions could be completely new or use pre-existing elements that have been adapted 
        and/or combined, creating new relationships between them. People might use several ways of 
        thinking, including lateral, divergent, and convergent thinking.</p>
        <h3>Lateral Thinking</h3>
        <p class="def">Lateral thinking is based on finding creative or alternative solutions to a 
        challenge beyond logical or deductive reasoning, basically seeking to solve problems using unique methods. 
        This relies on creative thinking, and the ability to consider every aspect of a situation with a 
        unique approach or the willingness to look at things in a different way.</p>
        <h3>Divergent Thinking</h3>
        <p class="def">In simple terms, divergent thinking is when a person uses creativity and follows many lines of 
        thought and the free flow of ideas to examine a problem to generate new/original solutions. Essentially,
        it is a non-linear thought process that analyses a solution on a broad scale and encourages multiple and 
        relatively scattered solutions. Compared to other thought processes, divergent thinking is a non-linear method. 
        It includes shifting perspective on existing information (seeing it in a new way) or transforming it, for 
        instance, through unexpected combinations of elements usually not regarded as belonging together.</p>
        <h3>Convergent Thinking</h3>
        <p class="def">The convergent thought process involves using logic and established information to reach a definitive solution, 
        often eliminating ambiguity and conducting steps, such as examining logical data and establishing constraints, to make 
        an informed conclusion. It evaluates various possibilities and applies established rules and logical reasoning to converge 
        on a single answer or the best possible solution. This is done using structure reasoning in sequential order, and critical evaluation 
        where each step logically follows the preceding and each possibility is analysed and dissected, clearing out the weaknesses and 
        flaws leaving only the most viable options for solutions.</p>

        <p class="def2">1: Ask questions and challenge any assumptions and existing norms by asking what-ifs, 
        how, why, can it/I, and allowing yourself to explore new possibilities. Asking such questions can help 
        you connect thoughts and ideas and think differently.</p>
        <img src="Images/Nav/HintsanTipsBar.png" alt="row of alternating coloured lightbulbs">
        <p class="def">2: Seek new perspectives and seek out differing viewpoints and ways of thinking and doing 
        by exposing yourself to various cultures, disciplines, and interests. Broaden your horizons and 
        improve your ability to think creatively.</p>
        <img src="Images/Nav/HintsanTipsBar.png" alt="row of alternating coloured lightbulbs">
        <p class="def">3: Allow free thinking and mind wandering. Don't let yourself be restricted in your thoughts 
        and ideas. The sky is the limit, so let the brain juices flow. Set aside time regularly to allow your mind 
        to wander, brainstorm and encourage free thinking, and doodle or write anything you want on paper to train your imagination.</p>
        <img src="Images/Nav/HintsanTipsBar.png" alt="row of alternating coloured lightbulbs">
        <p class="def">4: Take time, where possible, to bounce your ideas off others and gain their perspectives and ideas;

        <img src="Images/Nav/HintsanTipsBar.png" alt="row of alternating coloured lightbulbs">
        <p class="def">5: Take regular breaks; take a breather when you feel stuck with an idea. Forcing yourself to find a 
        solution will lead to exhaustion and burnout. Try going for a walk outside, grab a coffee or something to eat, talk 
        to people and/or just look at the scenery around you. Remember, some inspirations will strike you at unexpected times and places.</p>
        <img src="Images/Nav/HintsanTipsBar.png" alt="row of alternating coloured lightbulbs">

        <img src="Images/Nav/HintsanTipsBar.png" alt="row of alternating coloured lightbulbs">
        <p class="def">7: Find or create opportunities to stimulate your brain with new experiences. Go to an art gallery or museum, 
        go to a new part of your neighbourhood, go into an eatery you have never been to before, go see a performance, go into a 
        shop/window shop at a shop you would normally go into, listen to new music/music you would normally listen to or any new experiences you can think of.</p>
        <img src="Images/Nav/HintsanTipsBar.png" alt="row of alternating coloured lightbulbs">
        <p class="def">8: Unlock and embrace your inner child; step into pretend mode and participate in world-building (dreaming up entirely new worlds) 
        and perspective-shifting (thinking like another). The goal is to embrace openness toward new ideas and uncharted territory and think like an 
        adventure-seeking kid again.</p>
        <img src="Images/Nav/HintsanTipsBar.png" alt="row of alternating coloured lightbulbs">
        <p class="def">9: Take notes; inspiration and creative thought can strike at the most random times. When it strikes, 
        whether on paper or a phone app, jot the thought or idea down; otherwise, you may forget and not get it back.</p>
        <img src="Images/Nav/HintsanTipsBar.png" alt="row of alternating coloured lightbulbs">
        <p class="def">10: Keep a journal or scrapbook of inspirations; include images, little doodles, mark-making, and sketches of 
        any ideas where applicable and note any relevant emotions/feelings at the time, too.</p>

        more likely expose you to problems you can solve.</p>
        <img src="Images/Nav/HintsanTipsBar.png" alt="row of alternating coloured lightbulbs">
        <p class="def">4: Observe how other people solve problems; this can help develop your own skills, and if possible, 
        ask them relevant questions about their problem solving, like what brought you to this decision? Do you 
        have any other potential solutions? What is the initial problem?</p>
        <img src="Images/Nav/HintsanTipsBar.png" alt="row of alternating coloured lightbulbs">
        <p class="def">5: Participate in/complete practice problems; ask others to design or find problems for you to come 
        up with potential solutions to, search online for problems, or complete the challenges here on Think Creative. 
        Practice different solutions you could implement and evaluate them.</p>

        <p class="def">6: Document your processes and ideas; many can be solutions with the right refinement. Remember that if you 
        do when another problem arises, you may already have the solution or refinable options in your documentation.</p>
        <img src="Images/Nav/HintsanTipsBar.png" alt="row of alternating coloured lightbulbs">
        <p class="def">7: Explore the proven problem-solving processes available; some are available in Think Creatives processes, 
        and many are available online with a quick search. While not every process will solve every problem, they can steer you in 
        the right direction and provide helpful steps.</p>
        <img src="Images/Nav/HintsanTipsBar.png" alt="row of alternating coloured lightbulbs">
        <p class="def">8: Brainstorm all the ideas you can think of before judging, evaluating and refining. Just focus on generating lots of ideas first.</p>
        <img src="Images/Nav/HintsanTipsBar.png" alt="row of alternating coloured lightbulbs">
        <p class="def">9: Consider utilising a decision matrix; if you have several possibly effective solutions, a decision matrix can help you 
        decide the best option. Define the considerations you need/ desire the solution to meet and list. Define a rating scale, i.e. 
        0 (not at all), 1 (not enough), 2 ( a little), 3 ( average), etc. The solution is the one that meets the highest score/best meets the consideration scale.</p>
