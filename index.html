        <h1>Creativity Definition</h1>
        <p class="defRef">Synthesised from: Oxford Learners Dictionary, American Psychology Association.</p>
        <p class="def">Creativity is the ability to go beyond the ordinary to produce or develop original work, theories, 
        techniques or thoughts, typically displaying originality, imagination, and expressiveness.</p>
        <p class="def"> It can be practised and developed in many different outlets, such as the visual arts, 
        literature, sciences, creating problems, solving problems, and general day-to-day life. </p>

        <h1>Creativity Fun Facts</h1>
        <p class="def">1: Creativity is not something you just have or not; creativity can be learned, practised, and nurtured. 
        It is something you can continue to improve on.</p>
        <img src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.png" alt="row of alternating cogs and lighbulbs">
        <p class="def">2: Creativity is driven by curiosity and exploration.</p>
        <img src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.png" alt="row of alternating cogs and lighbulbs">
        <p class="def">3: Creativity is subjective based on unique perspectives and experiences shaping the individual's creative 
        expressions, resulting in a diverse range of creative outputs. What is considered creative can change from person to person.</p>
        <img src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.png" alt="row of alternating cogs and lighbulbs">
        <p class="def">4: Our environments can have a huge impact on our creativity. Well-designed spaces with adequate lighting and 
        comfort can stimulate creative thinking. As can colours, sounds, and smells.</p>
        <img src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.png" alt="row of alternating cogs and lighbulbs">
        <p class="def">5: Our moods and emotions can affect our creativity. Positive emotions can enhance creativity, but our more 
        challenging and difficult emotions can inspire them. So, try to be creative even if you are upset or angry.</p>
        <img src="Images/Nav/FunFactsAndProcesses.png" alt="row of alternating cogs and lighbulbs">
        <p class="def">6: Creativity is a risk-taking activity. Embracing uncertainty and being willing to make mistakes can

        You have decided you will be the one to explore and map this.</p>
        <p class="def">The first step is to design, draw/describe/sculpt the submersible technology to do this; 
        it needs to be able to at least film all 360 degrees of the surrounding area.</p>
        <p class="def">Questions to consider and possibly answer: What does this submersible look like? what does it sound like?
        how does it move and explore? how does it withstand pressure? and what technologies does it use? How does it supply you with air? 
        What food and drink are available and how? How will you relax and sleep? How will you continuously film and record information?</p>

        <p class="def">This doesn't have to be realistic or within the scope of our abilities and technologies we have right now. Start making connections between

        <h3>Prompts and Challenges 17: Adapting to Future:</h3>
        <p class="def">Our life as we know it is about to end/change, Volcanic cracks are beginning to appear worldwide on land and
        ocean floors; pyroclastic flows (flowing mix of rocks, gas and ash) are appearing, everything is heating up, 
        massive eruptions are imminent, and so are tsunamis.</p>
        <p class="def">What is the outcome for us, i.e. do we survive and somehow adapt? Do some of us make it off the planet to start a new colony; 
        maybe even back to Earth if nature recovers? Do we go extinct like the dinosaurs, but some evolutions of living beings survive and 
        continue to evolve? If so, what comes next?</p>
    </sl-dialog>
    <sl-dialog class="PromptsChallenges PromptsChallenges18" style="--width:50vw;">
        <h3>Prompts and Challenges 18: Cogs of Time:</h3>
        <p class="def">Use this as a writing or drawing prompt:  As the cogs turn forward, so does time. If only we could control time with cogs: 
        turning back time, stopping time, slowing it down, or speeding it up.</p>
        <p class="def">Maybe if we added or took cogs away, we could create new timelines or take cogs from one timeline and put them in another. 
        Imagine if time travel and entering different timelines was as simple as taking your cog out of the current timeline and placing it at a different point.</p>
        <p class="def">This could create the potential, for better or worse, for creating new worlds or endless destruction, manipulating events and opportunities.</p>

        <h1>Creative Thinking Definition</h1>
        <p class="defRef">Synthesised from: American Psychology Association, 
        Australian Council for Education Research, Oxford University.</p>
        <p class="def">Creative Thinking, just like creativity, falls on a spectrum 
        of beliefs and ways of doing with no singular, wholly accepted definition. A 
        generalised understanding is that creative thinking is a way of looking at problems or 
        situations from new or different perspectives; it is the mental process leading to new 
        possibilities, new ideas, inventions, solutions, or syntheses in any area.</p> 
        <p class="def">Solutions could be completely new or use pre-existing elements that have been adapted 
        and/or combined, creating new relationships between them. People might use several ways of 
        thinking, including lateral, divergent, and convergent thinking.</p>
        <h3>Lateral Thinking</h3>
        <p class="def">Lateral thinking is based on finding creative or alternative solutions to a 
        challenge beyond logical or deductive reasoning, basically seeking to solve problems using unique methods. 
        This relies on creative thinking, and the ability to consider every aspect of a situation with a 
        unique approach or the willingness to look at things in a different way.</p>
        <h3>Divergent Thinking</h3>
        <p class="def">In simple terms, divergent thinking is when a person uses creativity and follows many lines of 
        thought and the free flow of ideas to examine a problem to generate new/original solutions. Essentially,
        it is a non-linear thought process that analyses a solution on a broad scale and encourages multiple and 
        relatively scattered solutions. Compared to other thought processes, divergent thinking is a non-linear method. 
        It includes shifting perspective on existing information (seeing it in a new way) or transforming it, for 
        instance, through unexpected combinations of elements usually not regarded as belonging together.</p>
        <h3>Convergent Thinking</h3>
        <p class="def">The convergent thought process involves using logic and established information to reach a definitive solution, 
        often eliminating ambiguity and conducting steps, such as examining logical data and establishing constraints, to make 
        an informed conclusion. It evaluates various possibilities and applies established rules and logical reasoning to converge 
        on a single answer or the best possible solution. This is done using structure reasoning in sequential order, and critical evaluation 
        where each step logically follows the preceding and each possibility is analysed and dissected, clearing out the weaknesses and 
        flaws leaving only the most viable options for solutions.</p>

        <p class="defRef">Synthesised from: Cambridge University, Merriam-Webster.</p>
        <p class="def">Problem-solving is a process that occurs through higher mental functions, 
        such as reasoning and creative thinking.</p>
        <p class="def">It is centred around identifying, well-defining and understanding problems, 
        then determining the cause or causes of the problem before identifying and prioritizing possible 
        solutions, implementing the best course of action, testing and evaluating these solutions and, 
        if needed, adapting or choosing a different course of action.</p>
        <p class="def">There are several different methods and processes that could be used in 
        problem-solving, including brainstorming, mind-mapping, lightning decision jam, 
        design sprint, and crazy eight technique.</p>
